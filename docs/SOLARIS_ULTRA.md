# Solaris Ultra Design System 🚀✨

**Solaris Ultra** is a premium, spatial design language designed for the 2026 digital standard. It focuses on depth, fluid motion, and high-fidelity visibility.

## 🎨 Color Palette (Solaris V4 Ultimate)
- **Primary Grid:** `#020617` (Deep Indigo-Black)
- **Solaris Flux:** Radiant gradients across cyan, violet, and pink.
- **Glass Tokens:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` with inner-glow borders and 50px blur.

## 🧊 Spatial Components

### Bento Grid 2.0
A modular, high-fidelity dashboard layout with vertical clearing.
*   **Physics:** Transitioned from `whileInView` to active `animate` props for guaranteed visibility across all grid nodes.
*   **Header Hardening:** All visual headers (Maps, Charts) are enforced with `min-height` constraints to prevent container collapse on high-velocity data loads.

### Dynamic Account Matrix
Localized citizen profile cards that synchronize in real-time.
*   **Ranking:** Unified ranking logic ("SOLARIS CITIZEN" baseline).
*   **Verification:** Radiant `BadgeCheck` pulses indicating active forensic uplink status.

## 🌊 Interaction Physics
- **Haptic Feedback:** Micro-vibrations simulated via scale-shifts and luminance-pulses on button interaction.
- **Mesh Shaders:** Real-time evolutionary background gradients utilizing `radial-gradient` flux and noise textures.
